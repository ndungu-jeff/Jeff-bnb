I used postgresql instead of using seeds inorder to test my routes in postman.

sudo apt-get install postgres.

I generated four serializers of client, house,owner and client house where I intialied the attributes i wanted to display in the postman.

<!-- models -->
In the models file, I validated the attributes and implemented the one to many and many to many associations.
